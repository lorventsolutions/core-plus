# Compile Assets

If you don't have good knowledge on node js and npm, you can copy public folder files from codecanyon's downloaded files.

## Note:

Make sure you have node.js installed in your system and gulp, bower installed globally.

## Install local packages

`npm install`

## Get bower components

`bower install`

## Move Assets to public

`gulp`

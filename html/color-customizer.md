# Color Customizer

css files in the folder**`customizer`**responsible for the customization of pages \(mainly primary color settings\).

If you use sass, there is no need to enable CSS files from folder**`customizer`**. To change the primary color, you need to change the variable**`$general-color`**in the file**`_theme-variables.scss`**into the needed one.

If you don't use SASS \(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet\), then the main color can be changed in the appropriative file in the folder**`customizer`**.
